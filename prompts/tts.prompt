Module: tts
Purpose: Convert text to speech using ElevenLabs API, supporting English and Spanish. For Spanish, translate text via Claude first.

Input: text: str, lang: str ("en" or "es")
Output: None (plays audio as side effect)

Dependencies: elevenlabs, anthropic, tempfile, os, subprocess

Behavior:
- Provide a `speak(text: str, lang: str = "en") -> None` function.
- If lang is "es", first translate the text to Spanish using Claude API (anthropic.Anthropic, model claude-sonnet-4-20250514, simple prompt "Translate the following to Spanish: {text}").
- Send the (possibly translated) text to ElevenLabs API to generate speech audio.
- For English, use a default English voice ID.
- For Spanish, use a Spanish-language voice ID.
- Receive the audio bytes, save to a temporary MP3 file.
- Play the audio using `os.startfile(temp_path)` on Windows (opens default media player).
- Wait briefly for playback to start, then return. The temp file will be cleaned up on next call or app exit.

Configuration:
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY from environment variable
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from environment variable (for translation)
- Voice IDs: configurable constants at module level, defaults provided

Function signatures:
    def speak(text: str, lang: str = "en") -> None
    def translate_to_spanish(text: str) -> str

Edge cases:
- If ElevenLabs API fails, fall back to printing the text to console and continue without audio.
- If translation fails, speak the original English text and log a warning.
- If os.startfile is not available (non-Windows), use subprocess with a fallback player.
