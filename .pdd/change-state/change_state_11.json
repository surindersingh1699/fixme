Here's what I found:\n\n**Status:** No duplicates found\n\n**Search performed:**\n- Reviewed all 15 issues (1-15) in the repository\n- Searched using key terms: \"history\", \"sidebar\", \"export\", \"search filter\", \"conversation\", \"session deletion\"\n- Checked both open and closed issues\n\n**Findings:**\n- Issue #10 (closed) mentioned \"Fix History\" but focused on viewing past diagnoses, not the advanced features requested in issue #11\n- Issue #15 mentioned \"history panel\" but only in the context of linking screen recordings to sessions\n- No other issues address the specific features requested: full-text search, date-range filtering, session deletion with confirmation, and session export in multiple formats\n\n**Conclusion:** Issue #11 is a unique feature request focused on enhancing the existing HistoryManager with search, filtering, deletion, and export capabilities. The findings have been posted as a comment on the GitHub issue, and the workflow can proceed to Step 2: Documentation Check.",
    "2": "Perfect! I have successfully completed Step 2: Documentation Check and posted my findings to the GitHub issue.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've completed the documentation check for issue #11. Here's what I found:\n\n**Status:** Not Implemented\n\n**Documentation Reviewed:**\n- README.md - General features and setup\n- architecture.md - Technical architecture details  \n- fixme/ui.py - Source code implementation\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- The `HistoryManager` class exists with basic functionality (new_session, add_message, get_sessions, get_session)\n- Sessions are stored in `~/.fixme/history.json`\n- The sidebar displays history with simple \"Today\"/\"Earlier\" grouping\n\n**Missing Features (all requested features need to be built):**\n- No search capability\n- No date-range filtering\n- No session deletion functionality\n- No export features (JSON or plain-text)\n- No confirmation dialogs\n\n**Conclusion:** The workflow continues to Step 3: Identify Dev Units. All the requested enhancement features need to be implemented from scratch, though the basic history infrastructure already exists.",
    "3": "Perfect! The research findings have been successfully posted to GitHub issue #11. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished.\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully completed **Step 3: Research & Clarification** for issue #11 and posted comprehensive findings to the GitHub issue.\n\n### Key Research Accomplishments:\n\n**1. Technical Background Research:**\n- Identified best practices for full-text search in Python/tkinter applications\n- Found standard patterns for confirmation dialogs using `messagebox.askyesno()`\n- Researched file export standards (JSON and plain text formats)\n- Investigated datetime filtering approaches for conversation history\n\n**2. Best Practices Identified:**\n- Real-time search using StringVar with trace for automatic UI updates\n- Left sidebar filter placement (consistent with current design)\n- Standard confirmation dialog patterns for destructive actions\n- Industry-standard export formats used by ChatGPT and Slack\n\n**3. Refined Specifications:**\n- Search: Case-insensitive across title AND message content with real-time filtering\n- Date filtering: Start/end date fields with validation\n- Deletion: Confirmation dialog with active session handling\n- Export: Both JSON (programmatic) and plain text (human-readable) formats\n- File selection: Using tkinter's native file dialogs\n\n**4. Alternative Approaches Evaluated:**\n- Decided against external libraries (Whoosh, SQLite) to maintain simplicity\n- Chose visible buttons over right-click menus for better discoverability\n- Rejected Markdown export to focus on specified requirements\n\n**5. Implementation Phases Recommended:**\n- Phase 1: Search/Filter functionality\n- Phase 2: Session deletion with confirmation\n- Phase 3: Export capabilities\n\n### Sources Referenced:\n- [Python tkinter documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dialog.html)\n- [Search UX best practices](https://www.designmonks.co/blog/search-ux-best-practices)\n- [PatternFly Chatbot patterns](https://www.patternfly.org/patternfly-ai/chatbot/chatbot-conversation-history/)\n- [Whoosh full-text search](https://github.com/mchaput/whoosh)\n- [vCon conversation data standard](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-vcon-vcon-core-01.html)\n- [Slack export guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/201658943-Export-your-workspace-data)\n- And several other authoritative sources\n\nThe research provides a solid foundation for implementation with clear, actionable specifications while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase architecture (pure tkinter, JSON storage, simple patterns).",
    "4": "Perfect! I have successfully posted the requirements clarity check to GitHub issue #11.\n\n## Summary\n\nI've completed **Step 4: Requirements Clarity Check** and determined that clarification is needed on one critical aspect before proceeding with implementation.\n\n### Assessment Results:\n\n**Overall Status:** Clarification Needed (workflow paused)\n\n**What's Well-Defined (90% clear):**\n- Search functionality with full specifications from Step 3 research\n- Date range filtering approach\n- Session deletion with confirmation dialog\n- Export formats (JSON and plain text)\n- UI integration patterns\n\n**Critical Ambiguity Identified:**\nThe **export scope** is undefined - the issue doesn't specify whether users should be able to:\n- Export individual sessions only\n- Export all sessions in bulk\n- Both options\n\nThis significantly impacts UI design because it determines:\n- Button placement (per-session vs. global)\n- Dialog prompts and user workflow\n- File naming conventions\n- Consistency with the per-session deletion pattern\n\n### Question Posted:\n\nI've asked @surindersingh1699 to choose between three options:\n- **A)** Per-session export only\n- **B)** Export all sessions only  \n- **C)** Both per-session and bulk export (recommended)\n\nI recommended Option C because the issue mentions both \"external use\" (suggesting selective export) and \"archival\" (suggesting bulk export), and it's consistent with industry patterns from ChatGPT and Slack.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nThe workflow is now **paused** awaiting the issue author's response. Once they reply with their preferred option and run `pdd change` again, Step 4 will re-evaluate with the new information and proceed to Step 5."
